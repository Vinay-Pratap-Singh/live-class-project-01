## **Topics I Learnt** ##

>Before completing this project I was not friendy with the concept of **CSS Positioning**. It was a concept to which I always tried to avoid as much as I can. But in order to complete this project, it was not possible to avoid css positioning.

>In order to learn CSS Positioning i started to watch LCO Web Development Videos but in order to get more clarity I switched to watch the videos of **Code With Harry** which gives me the complete clarity about this concept.

>I spend around **2 hours** to watch the videos and making notes and practicing them alongside while watching to clear my concept.

>First time I used **Google Fonts** in my project which was also a new thing for me to use.

## **Time Taken** ##
>I took around 2 hours to learn CSS Positioning and extra around 4 hours to create this project.
The whole amount of around **6 Hours** is invested of mine in this project.
